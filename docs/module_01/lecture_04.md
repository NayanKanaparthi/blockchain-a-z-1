# Distributed P2P Network

 Many different computers store the blockchain as part of a network. All changes
 get propagated throughout the network, eventually. 

 If one blockchain gets corrupted because of a malicious user, it will be
 validated by checking against all of the other networks.

 This means, that in order to hack a blockchain on a distributed system, it would require a
 hacker to hack all of the computers at the same time. Which would be nearly impossible.

 The more computers as part of a network, the harder it becomes to hack the blockchain.

 You can use majority consensus to make the blockchain trustable.
