# What is a Blockchain?

> A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. -Wikipeida

* A blockchain has three parts. 


1. Data
2. Previous Hash
3. Current Hash


* The first block is called the Genesis Block. A genesis block does not have
a previous hash.

* Blocks are cryptographically linked together.
